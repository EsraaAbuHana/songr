# songr
## Building Full-Stack Web Apps
## Overview
- In this Lab I will use the Spring Initializr to create a new application with artifact songr with Web and Thymeleaf (and optionally Devtools) dependencies.
- This is a simple web site which uses a backend written in Java. The site has `/hello`, `/capitalize/{word}`and `/albums`.
